# **Lead Scoring Case Study**

## **Objective**

-   An education company named X Education sells online courses to
    industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are
    interested in the courses land on their website and browse for
    courses. 

-   The company markets its courses on several websites and search
    engines like Google. When people fill up a form providing their
    email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.
    Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start
    making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the
    leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion
    rate at X education is around 30%.

-   The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign
    a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a
    higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers
    with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in
    particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate
    to be around 80%.
